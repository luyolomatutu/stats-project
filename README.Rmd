## Hello Octocat
I love Octocat. She's the coolest cat in town.

```{r, quick look, echo=TRUE}
data("anscombe")
dim(anscombe)
names(anscombe)
head(anscombe, n=6)
tail(anscombe, n=6)
summary(anscombe)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
